                        <p>At the Wellcome Trust, Lantern has enabled Open Access mandate compliance monitoring at a
                            scale not previously possible.  It's having an impact on the openness of the research they

                <strong>Our funding supports over 14,000 people in more than 70 countries</strong>.

                <p class="quote-attribution">Hannah Hope, Open Research Co-ordinator, Wellcome Trust</p>

                <p>Wellcome has had an <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/open-access-policy">open access policy</a> since 2005, requiring that research articles resulting
                    from Wellcome funding are made freely available. This policy applies to all grantees and funding
                    is provided to support the cost of making articles open access.</p>

                <p>Wellcome has an <a href="/organisations">Organisation Account</a> with Lantern, which means they
                    have a Wellcome-branded user interface, custom fields and compliance calculations.  You can visit
                    their instance at <a href="http://compliance.cottagelabs.com">http://compliance.cottagelabs.com</a>.</p>

                <h4>Why Automate?</h4>

                <p>Before the Lantern was developed Wellcome Trust had no automated way of compliance checking.
                    The Open Research team in Wellcome's London offices went through a manual process of searching
                    for DOIs and PubMed IDs in <a href="http://europepmc.org">Europe PMC</a>, to gather essential
                    information.  This included whether the article was in Europe PMC at all, and whether the
                    appropriate Creative Commons licence was visible.</p>

                <p>On one occasion Wellcome published a raw dataset of articles, and crowd-sourced the checking and
                    data enhancement from the community.  Though this was highly effective, they recognised
                    immediately that they needed an automated and scalable solution.  They turned to us at
                    Cottage Labs and ultimately Lantern, as we had also been working on this same problem in
                    collaboration with the <a href="http://plos.org">Public Library of Science (PLOS)</a>.</p>

                <h4>How is Lantern Used?</h4>

                <p class="pullout-quote">The key feature of the software is that it is able to pull content from multiple sources ...
                    each of which provides a different element of the compliance picture.</p>

                <p>Lantern is used by a variety of people within Wellcome Trust.  Grant Managers use it to ensure that
                    publications listed in grant reports are all compliant; they can only close the grants once they
                    are.  The Open Research team upload identifiers every month to keep an up-to-date picture of how
                    much of the Trust’s publication portfolio is compliant with their policy.  Meanwhile, the Insight
                    and Analysis team run customised datasets on an ad hoc basis as needed for their work.
                </p>

                <p>Once a year Wellcome run a full detailed bulk analysis for all articles for which they have paid an
                    article processing charge.  You can see the analysis for 2015-16 <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/wellcome-and-coaf-open-access-spend-2015-16">here</a></p>

                <p>The key feature of value to Wellcome is that Lantern is able to pull content from multiple
                    sources - for example, CrossRef to identify DOIs, DOAJ to determine if article is in a full OA
                    or hybrid journal, EPMC to check availability - each of which provides a different element of
                    the compliance picture.</p>

                <p>When Lantern identifies articles which do not comply with their policy, they work directly with the
                researchers, institutions and publishers to improve the access to their research.</p>

                <p>They also combine the results from the Lantern with additional information provided by grantees to
                    understand trends and costs within the scholarly publishing market.</p>

                <h4>Impact</h4>

                <p class="pullout-quote">We couldn’t do this work regularly without the tool as the time it would take
                    would be too great.</p>

                <p>Prior to using Lantern, Wellcome did not have the means to do any of this analysis in a meaningful
                    way.  They have used Lantern to measure the compliance with their open access mandate, which has a
                    global impact on access to critical biomedical and health research. </p>
