        <h3>What does Lantern do?</h3>

        <p>Lantern gives you the ability to pull together a full range of Open Access compliance measures used by funders and official agencies, making
            checking your publications incredibly easy.</p>

        <p>Just upload a list of your identifiers - like DOIs - and we'll learn everything we can about them and send you the results.</p>

        <h3>Quickstart</h3>

        <p><strong class="step">Step 1</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make a list of your identifiers.  This can be as a comma-separated list, or as a CSV.</p>

            <p>As a list, this might just be: 10.1080/0005772x.1997.11099339, 10.2307/40132944, 10.1017/cbo9781139506427</p>

            <p>As a CSV, you can start with your favourite spreadsheet program, and create a sheet like the example below.  As long as it has one or more of the headers "DOI", "PMID" or "PMICD" it will work:

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
                <table class="examplecsv">
                    <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <td>DOI</td>
                        <td>PMID</td>
                        <td>PMCID</td>
                    </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>10.abc/123</td>
                        <td>78543277</td>
                        <td>&nbsp;</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>10.jkl/8999/1</td>
                        <td>&nbsp;</td>
                        <td>&nbsp;</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>&nbsp;</td>
                        <td>78024443</td>
                        <td>PMC75220165</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>...</td>
                        <td>...</td>
                        <td>...</td>
                    </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
            </div>

        </div>

        <p>Once you've done that, export it as a CSV.  In Excel you can do this by choosing <strong>Save As</strong> and selecting <strong>CSV (Comma delimited)</strong> as the type.  For more information see <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-or-export-text-txt-or-csv-files-5250ac4c-663c-47ce-937b-339e391393ba#bmexport">Microsoft's support page</a>.</p>

        <p><strong class="step">Step 2</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy your identifier list into the input box or use the "upload a file" link on our <a href="#">front page</a>.</p>

        <p><strong class="step">Step 3</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a break, put your feet up and let us do all the work.  Depending on how many identifiers you've given us, it might take a little while to gather the results.  We'll email you when they're ready.</p>

        <p><strong class="step">Step 5</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to your finished report page.  Here you can view a summary of the results, and download the full report as a CSV, which you can then open up in your spreadsheet package.  You can also share this page, so others can see your results too.</p>

        <br>

        <p>You'll have the following information available to you in the spreadsheet:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Some additional basic bibliographic information, such as Journal, Publisher, Title, and publication dates</li>
            <li>Whether the publication is in a repository (and which repositories)</li>
            <li>Whether the publication appears in EuropePMC, and some information about its status and version</li>
            <li>What re-use licence the publisher has applied</li>
            <li>Any embargo information about this publisher</li>
            <li>Any self-archiving policies for the pre-print, post-print or publisher's version</li>
            <li>Grant and PI information</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you want the full details of what information we gather, check out the <a href="#advanced">output documentation</a>, below.</p>

        <p>In order to get you this information, Lantern queries a lot of external data services, so you should check out our <a href="/sources">sources</a> page for more information on what we use and the re-use
            rights they may apply to the data</p>
