            <p>Lantern gives you the ability to pull together a full range of Open Access compliance measures used by funders and official agencies, making 
            checking your publications incredibly easy.</p>
            
            <p>Just upload a list of your identifiers - like DOIs - and we'll learn everything we can about them and send you the results.  <!-- You can also integrate with our <a href="">API</a>!--></p>
            
            <p><strong class="step">Step 1</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put your identifiers in a spreadsheet.  As long as the sheet has one or more of "DOI", "PMID" or "PMCID" in the header row, with the corresponding identifiers underneath it,
            we can can work with it.</p>
            
            <p>For example:</p>
            
            <div class="row">

            <p><strong class="step">Step 2</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save your spreadsheet as a CSV.  In Excel you can do this by choosing <strong>Save As</strong> and selecting <strong>CSV (Comma delimited)</strong> as the type.  For more information see <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-or-export-text-txt-or-csv-files-5250ac4c-663c-47ce-937b-339e391393ba#bmexport">Microsoft's support page</a>.</p>
            
            <p><strong class="step">Step 3</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/login">Sign in</a> to Lantern and upload your CSV via the upload form on your home page.</p>
            
            <p><strong class="step">Step 4</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait for us to gather the results for you.  You can watch the progress bar or go off and grab a coffee.  If you've given us a LOT of identifiers maybe go home
            and check back tomorrow.  Either way, we'll email you with a link to the results when your job is finished.</p>
            
            <p><strong class="step">Step 5</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Download the results (which are also in a CSV) and then open them in your favourite spreadsheet program.  Excel will happily open CSVs for you, and allow
            you to re-save them as .xls files.</p>
            
			<p>That's it!</p>
			<br>

            <p>You'll have the following information available to you in the spreadsheet:</p>
            
            <ul>
				<li>Some additional basic bibliographic information, such as Journal, Publisher, Title, and publication dates</li>
                <li>Whether the publication is in a repository (and which repositories)</li>
                <li>Whether the publication appears in EuropePMC, and some information about its status and version</li>
                <li>What re-use licence the publisher has applied</li>
                <li>Any embargo information about this publisher</li>
