                        <p>Your Open Access policy is an important part of your identity, and you want researchers, institutions and publishers you fund to comply with it.
                        You may want to take action if you find your policy isn't being met, and to do that you need to quickly and easily identify publications
                        which haven't quite lived up to your standards.  Finding those publications in your returns from institutions can be time consuming and
                        costly, and Lantern makes that process much easier.</p>

                        <p>With your own Lantern you can make it easy for your compliance team to review your returns from institutions, gathering
                        exactly the information you are interested in, and even having compliance to your policy automatically calculated for you.  Not only that,
                        you can ask institutions and researchers to use your branded interface themselves, to ensure that they are compliant before they submit
                        their returns.</p>

                        how adoption and compliance is progressing.  You may also have requirements placed upon you by external parties, such as government or
                        funders, and you want to be sure you can meet their policies too.  You can use Lantern for checking your institutional
                        publication records as well as each of your funder or REF returns.  If you identify publcations which do not live up to those standards, you can
                        work with your researchers to improve access to their work.</p>

                        <p>With your own Lantern you can brand and embed the system in your institutional website, making it easy for researchers
                        to check their publications within the context of their home institution.  Your Open Access team can also check your publications in bulk
                        and gather exactly the information they are interested in, and even have compliance to your your own Open Access policy calculated for you.
                            With access to our API, you can also integrate compliance lookups into your repository, research information system, or research
                        management system.</p>

                        availability of their work, and you play a big part in that.  Whether you publish Open Access, or a mixture of Open and traditional
                        articles, you may wish to use Lantern to check your own list of publications to determine how they appear to your users and

                        <p>With your own Lantern, using your branding, you can make a strong statement to the community that you are committed to
                        Open Access.  Meanwhile, your team can check your publication back catalogue, and monitor ongoing publications, gathering
                        exactly the information they need to act on.  This might result in changes to how you present content on your website, or
                        lead to conversations with third parties on how they represent your material to maximise your presence.</p>
