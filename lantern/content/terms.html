                <h4>Privacy and Copyright Protection</h4>

                <p>Cottage Labs may collect information about you and your Organisation through normal use of the Service.  This will include:</p>

                <ul>
                <li>Information you give us.  For example, your user account email addresses and other personal information</li>
                <li>Information we get through the use of our Service.  For example, identifiers for research articles, and their associated metadata.</li>
                <li>Log information.  When you use our Service, we automatically collect and store information in server logs, such as IP
                    address, device information, and the actions you are taking</li>
                <li>Cookies.  Used to store information when you interact with our Service.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We work hard to protect our users from unauthorised access to, alteration of, disclosure or destruction of the information
                    that we hold. Our Service is provided over an encrypted connection, and user passwords are stored in encrypted form only.
                    Access to personal information is restricted to only Cottage Labs members who need to know that information to process it.</p>

                <p>Cottage Labs will not re-distribute your personal information to 3rd parties under any circumstances, except as may be required by law.</p>

                <p>We use the information we collect from all our Service to provide, maintain, protect and improve it, and to develop new
                    ones and to protect Cottage Labs and our users.  By using our Service, you agree that Cottage Labs can use such data in this way.</p>

                <h4>Your Content</h4>

                <p>You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in the content that you upload to our Service.</p>

                <p>When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Service, you give Cottage Labs (and those we
                    work with) a worldwide licence to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, communicate,
                    publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights that you grant in this
                    licence are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting and improving our Service, and to develop new ones.
                    This licence continues even if you stop using our Service.  Make sure that you have the necessary rights to grant us
                    this licence for any content that you submit to our Services.</p>

                <h4>Data Provided by our Service</h4>

                <p>Our Service aggregates content from a variety of sources in order to provide the responses to your Open Access requests.
                    We do not make any assertion as to the accuracy of the data provided by those 3rd party services.</p>

                <p>Third party services may apply usage restrictions on the data we provide to you, and you should refer to their Terms
                    and Conditions before making further use of their data.  Please refer to the <a href="#">Data sources</a> documentation for
                    information about 3rd party services used by Lantern, and for links to those services.</p>

                <p>We do our best to ensure that we provide you with complete data for your request, but in the event that any of the 3rd
                    party services fails to respond, either temporarily or permanently, we may omit information from that source from our
                    response.  We will maintain a dialogue with our data sources in an effort to ensure such disruptions are kept to a minimum.
                    In some cases it may be necessary to permanently remove some 3rd parties from our responses at short notice, and we
                    cannot be held liable.  You should check our website for the changes to the data sources.</p>


                <h4>Payment</h4>

                <p>You must buy Credits in advance to process two or more identifiers in a single request.</p>

                <p>Receipts for payment will be issued by us only at your request.</p>


                <h4>Termination and Amendment</h4>

                <p>We may terminate your account for any transgression of these terms.  If you do not have active Credit we reserve
                    the right to terminate your account at our discretion for any reason.</p>

                <p>If, due to circumstances beyond our control, we have to make any change in our Service or how it is provided, we will
                    notify you via your registered email address immediately. We will use reasonable endeavours to keep any such changes to a minimum.</p>

                <p>Credits are non-refundable under any circumstances (such as that your account is
                    terminated), unless otherwise agreed in terms between us.</p>

                <h4>Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h4>

                <p>We provide our Service using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care. But there are certain things that we
                    do not promise about our Services.</p>

                <p>Other than as expressly set out in these Terms, neither Cottage Labs nor its suppliers or distributors makes any
                    specific promises about the Service. For example, we do not make any commitments about the content within the Services,
                    the specific functions of the Services or their reliability, availability or ability to meet your needs. We provide the
                    Services "as is".</p>

                <p>Some jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like the implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular
                    purpose and non-infringement. To the extent permitted by law, we exclude all warranties.</p>

                <h4>Organisation Account Service Level</h4>

                <p>If you are an Organisation Account holder, you are entitled to the following level of service:</p>

                <ul>
                <li>There can be up to 30 minutes of scheduled maintenance during the month.  We will endeavour to schedule maintenance at low-usage times.</li>
                <li>The API and the interface will be available 99.5% of the time in any month, after taking into consideration scheduled maintenance.</li>
                <li>The API and User Interface will be as responsive as is reasonable, depending on the amount of data you are providing to it in any one request.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In the event that you encounter a problem accessing our Service, please contact us as soon as possible, with details.</p>

                <p>If we do not meet the level of service detailed above, you will be entitled to receive Service Credits.  A Service
                    Credit is a 5% reduction in your next Organisation Account renewal cost, up to a maximum of 5 Service Credits in any year.</p>

                <p>To receive your Service Credit you must notify us within 5 days of the issue.  Availability of our Service will be
                    measured through the use of third party monitoring tools, and statistics will be available upon request.</p>

                <p>Service Credits will not be available in the case of a Force Majeure event, which will include malicious activity or
                    unreasonable and excessive usage load on our Service.</p>

                <p>Usage of Organisation accounts is subject to a (high) limit.  We will confirm your annual limit with you at the start of the contract.
                If you exceed your limit, we will invoice you for any additional requests at the standard Credit rate.  In this event, if
                the Organisation does not settle the invoice, we may freeze the Organisation account until the next billing period.</p>

                <h4>About these Terms</h4>

                <p>We may modify these terms to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Service. You should look at
                    the terms regularly. Changes will not apply retrospectively and will become effective no earlier than fourteen days
                    after they are published. However, changes addressing new functions for our Service or changes made for legal reasons
                    will be effective immediately.</p>

                <p>We will notify all account holders by email as and when the terms change.</p>

                <p>These terms govern the relationship between Cottage Labs and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.</p>

                <p>If you do not comply with these terms and we do not take action immediately, this doesn't mean that we are giving up
                    any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).</p>

                <p>If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.</p>

                <p>These terms are governed by and interpreted according to Scottish law. All disputes arising under these Terms are
                    subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Scottish courts.</p>
