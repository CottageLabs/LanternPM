                        report straight away.  We'll take you to the report page on our site, and you can watch the progress live, and we'll also send you an email with a link to the page.</p>

                    <p>When it's finished
                        we'll send you another email.  If you've only uploaded a few identifiers, it won't take very long!</p>

                <h5>By Uploading a Spreadsheet</h5>

                <p>If you want to upload spreadsheets from your computer, you can use our file upload option on the front page (when you are logged in).</p>

                <p>Just export a CSV from your favourite spreadsheet program, such as Excel, and then upload it to be processed.</p>

                <p>The content of your CSVs will need to look something like this, with up to 3 columns, one for each identifier type we accept:</p>

                <table class="examplecsv">
                    <tr>
                        <th>DOI</th>

                </table>

                <p>Once you've uploaded it, you'll get an email with a link for you to check our process with. Then when we're done
                    (which could take a few hours if you've given us a lot of rows) we'll email you with a link to download the results.</p>

                <p>Full details of the content of the results can be found in our <a href="#">documentation</a>.</p>


                <h5>Via our API</h5>

                <p>For organisations who want to see Lantern integrated into existing systems, such as your repository, CRIS or other publications or
                    compliance management system, we offer a fully-featured API option. With it you are able to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Send batches of article identifiers for processing</li>
                    <li>Monitor existing jobs that you created</li>
                    <li>Download partial or complete result sets</li>
                    <li>Check information about your user account, such as your credit amount</li>
                    <li>Get more granular access to the data that Lantern gathers than the spreadsheet upload does. Full information about it is available in our API documentation</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Access to the API is provided with our organisational account, which you can read more about <a href="#">here</a></p>

                <h4>How does it work?</h4>

                <p>Lantern takes a list of article identifiers (DOI, PMID and PMCID are supported), via a web form, a CSV upload, or submission via the API.</p>

                <p>Each identifier is used to query multiple websites and data sources to locate information relevant to the item's Open Access status;
                    for example, the re-use licence, whether it has been archived in an open repository, what embargo policies the journal has in place, etc.</p>

                <p>Once all identifiers have been queried, the results can be retrieved via our website, as a CSV, or via the API.</p>

                <p>Lantern aggregates data from a variety of sources</p>
