                <p>Lantern takes a list of article identifiers (DOI, PMID and PMCID are supported), via a web form, a CSV upload, or submission via the API.</p>

                <p>Each identifier is used to query multiple websites and data sources to locate information relevant to the item's Open Access status;
                    for example, the re-use licence, whether it has been archived in an open repository, what embargo policies the journal has in place, etc.</p>

                <p>Once all identifiers have been queried, the results can be retrieved via our website, as a CSV, or via the API.</p>

                <p>Lantern aggregates data from a variety of sources</p>

                <p>If you represent an organisation, and you want your own custom version of Lantern, we can arrange that for you.  You
                    can have it branded, appearing within your organisation's web domain, customised to gather specific data, and to
                    automatically calculate compliance to your policies and any other relevant policies.</p>
